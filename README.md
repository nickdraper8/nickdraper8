### Hi. My Name is Nick Draper, welcome to my GitHub Profile!
Currently, I work at Draftkings in Boston as a Seniot Software Engineer using technologies like React, Gatsby, GraphQL, Node.js, TypeScript and of course JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In my free time, I like to work on personal coding projects, hike 4000 footers in New Hampshire, snowboard, and explore my home of Boston.
