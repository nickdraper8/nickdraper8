### Hi. My Name is Nick Draper, welcome to my GitHub Profile!
Currently a full-time job seeker, I am constantly improving my existing projects, coming up with ideas for new things to work on, and sharpening my Data Structures and Algorithms skills using LeetCode and other resourses to become a stronger engineer.

I am really excited to find my first software engineering role at a company that values strong work ethic and cares about fostering the growth of their employees.
